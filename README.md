## Operations this app supports
### Edge Detection
Edge detection is a technique used to identify the boundaries of objects within an image. It helps in highlighting the edges of structures in brain tumor images, making it easier to analyze them.

### Histogram Equalization
Histogram equalization is a method used to improve the contrast of an image by redistributing the intensity levels. It can enhance the visibility of features in brain tumor images.

### Morphological Operations
Morphological operations involve the use of structuring elements to process binary images. These operations, such as dilation and erosion, can help in enhancing or removing certain features in the image.
