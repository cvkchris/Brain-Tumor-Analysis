# Brain-Tumor-Analysis

## About
This application is designed to help you analyze brain tumor images. It provides various image processing techniques on MRI images and classifies the image into 4 classes using a CNN model. 

### Classes of MRI Image
The 4 types of MRI images used to train the model are:
* Glioma Tumor
* Pituitary Tumor
* Meningioma Tumor
* No Tumor (Normal Brain)

## Operations this app supports
### Edge Detection
Edge detection is a technique used to identify the boundaries of objects within an image. It helps in highlighting the edges of structures in brain tumor images, making it easier to analyze them.

### Histogram Equalization
Histogram equalization is a method used to improve the contrast of an image by redistributing the intensity levels. It can enhance the visibility of features in brain tumor images.

### Morphological Operations
Morphological operations involve the use of structuring elements to process binary images. These operations, such as dilation and erosion, can help in enhancing or removing certain features in the image.
